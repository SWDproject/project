Lesson: Software Design Principles
Software design is the process of organizing and structuring program components to be efficient and maintainable.
Key principles include:
 • Modularity: Dividing the program into independent, reusable units.
 • Encapsulation: Hiding implementation details and protecting data.
 • Separation of Concerns: Separating different functions in the program to ease understanding and development.
 • Reusability: Writing components that can be used in other projects.
 • Flexibility: The ability to easily modify the system when changes occur.
Applying these principles helps improve software quality and reduce errors.
